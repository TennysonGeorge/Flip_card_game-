## :dizzy: BLACKJACK CARD GAME :dizzy:

The Blackjack Card Game was created using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It allows the user to play Blackjack against the Dealer on a computer and a mobile device. The user is called the Player on the user interface. To start the game, the Player clicks the Deal button. After 4 cards are dealt, the Player may choose to click the Hit button which deals another card or to click the Stand button which tells the Dealer to stop dealing cards to the Player. Once the user clicks the Stand button, the application automatically deals the Dealer's cards if the Dealer has less than 17 points. After that, all the points are calculated, and a message is generated. The message informs the user who won that hand of Blackjack. It also gives an explanation as to why either the Dealer or the Player won. If the user wants to play another game, click the Deal button again.
